# <Console Finances Portfolio>

## Description

In this challenge I was asked to use the console to code and log the following data from a 2D array using Javascript:



1. log the Total Months included in the data set given
2. Code net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
3. workout average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period. (total amount/months)
4. Workout the greatest increase in profits and display the string dates and number values for each month
5. Workout the greatest decrease in profits and display the string dates and number values for each month

The first point in the challenge I found incredibly easy and was able to console log this without any research or code


The final 4 tasks I have found incredibly frustrating as I feel that I am near to getting solutions but cannot access the answers.

For point 2 I have programmed for many hours using many different methods from using ++ to *= and commands such as reduce acc and indexing nested arrays.

I was unable to complete or really attempt point three as I was unsucessful in totalling the values to then produce an average

I looked at the min and max values for points 4 and 5 and also looked at programming using variables and comparing using the < sign.

Overall I was very disapointed in this challenge and the lack of outcomes I feel I do not seem to have enough knowledge to grasp the concepts and apply knowledge to these situations.

I have resolved to take a break from this, submit the challenge and then go back and improve at a later date when I feel better informed  and have a better grasp of  knowledge of 2D arrays and using indices.

# Updates

Since the first attempt at this assignment I have managed to find some functions that have worked successfully. 

Task 1 - Already completed (Months shown)
Task 2 - This was almost completed but after playing around with the code I realised that I needed to set my variable to 0 as an error kept occuring that said Not a Number.
Task 3 - I went online and found some code that looped through the values but I needed to add an if statement to show that if the value was not equal to the length of the array I think that this identified the minus values. In the console log I got the total changes to divide the months to return an average
Task 4 - I originally thought that  by adding in the math.max and min values it would automatically generate the values but found out that in this case I had not linked my array to a series of values. This proved much more complicated that I originally thought. I used the map function to create an array with an if statement that checked if the value was 0 if the value was zero then it returned 0 if my program returned the values it mapped out a new array called finances in the second column(1) compared this to the original array and returned the lowest value using the indexOf command to search for the value I applied the math max documentation to display the highest value. 
Task 5 - I was able to replicate the code for the highest value to show the greatest decrease by implementing the Mathmin function that I had originally used.

I have used the w3schools website to look at basic command words and functions



I watched videos on you tube from Alvin the programmer on nested loops

There are no main features in this task only a console log set out in a specific way that I did not achieve

## Tests

I have tested many times through the console log on the web browser and at one point made a smaller set of test data using a Javascript test but was unsucessful and only manage to achieve one of the five tasks.  I restarted many times afresh as I ended up having too much code that got commented out because it simply did not work and I just did not have the knowledge to modify the work.

I now feel incredibly overwhelmed and cannot continue at this moment on this challenge without support. I  will endeavor to see support if I do not improve my understanding of this moving forward. 

# Update on Tests

I tested through the console and when elements were not working I console logged the totalchanges and index to check these elements work working first this allowed me to continue with the resy og the code.
